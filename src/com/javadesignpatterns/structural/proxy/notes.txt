-> Acts as an interface to something else
-> Interface by wrapping
-> It can also add functionality to that wrapped object but not its main purpose
-> Proxy called to access real object

<!--DESIGN-->
-> Interface based
-> Interface and implementation class

<!--PITFALLS-->
-> Only one proxy
-> This adds one more abstraction layer
