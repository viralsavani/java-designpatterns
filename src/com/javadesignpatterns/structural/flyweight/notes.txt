-> Minimizes memory use with sharing data between similarly typed objects
-> It is an optimization pattern
-> Used when there are large number of similar objects, this is specially the case for the objects that are stateless or immutable

<!--DESIGN-->
-> Pattern of patterns
-> Utilizes a factory to retrieve the objects after they have been created
-> It often encompasses both creational and structural

<!--PITFALLS-->
-> A bit complex
-> Pre mature optimization
-> Must understand Factory
